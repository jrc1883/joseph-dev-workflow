# Skill Generator

## Overview

Create custom skills tailored to the specific project's patterns, workflows, and conventions. Skills become part of the project's .claude/skills/ directory.

**Core principle:** Capture project wisdom as reusable, teachable skills.

**Trigger:** `/generate-skills` command after project analysis

## What Gets Generated

```
.claude/skills/
├── [project]-patterns.md     # Project coding patterns
├── [project]-testing.md      # Testing conventions
├── [project]-deployment.md   # Deployment workflow
├── [project]-debugging.md    # Common debug scenarios
└── [project]-setup.md        # Dev environment setup
```

## Generation Process

### Step 1: Analyze Codebase

Discover patterns and conventions:

```bash
# Find common patterns
grep -r "// Pattern:" --include="*.ts" .
grep -r "# Pattern:" --include="*.py" .

# Find test patterns
ls tests/ __tests__/ spec/ 2>/dev/null

# Find CI/CD
ls .github/workflows/ .gitlab-ci.yml Jenkinsfile 2>/dev/null

# Find documentation
ls docs/ README.md CONTRIBUTING.md 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 2: Identify Skill Opportunities

Analyze for:

| Area | Look For | Skill Generated |
|------|----------|-----------------|
| Components | Repeated component patterns | component-patterns |
| API | REST/GraphQL patterns | api-patterns |
| State | Redux/Context/Zustand usage | state-management |
| Testing | Test file patterns | testing-conventions |
| Auth | Auth patterns | authentication-flow |
| Database | ORM patterns | database-patterns |

### Step 3: Generate Pattern Skill

```markdown
---
name: [project]-patterns
description: Coding patterns and conventions for [project]
---

# [Project] Coding Patterns

## Component Pattern

[Based on analysis of existing components]

### Standard Component Structure
\`\`\`typescript
// [Pattern discovered from codebase]
\`\`\`

### When to Use
- [Discovered use cases]

### Examples in Codebase
- `src/components/[Example1].tsx`
- `src/components/[Example2].tsx`

## API Pattern

[Based on analysis of API routes]

### Standard Route Structure
\`\`\`typescript
// [Pattern discovered from API routes]
\`\`\`

## Naming Conventions

- Components: [Discovered convention]
- Files: [Discovered convention]
- Functions: [Discovered convention]
```

### Step 4: Generate Testing Skill

```markdown
---
name: [project]-testing
description: Testing conventions and patterns for [project]
---

# [Project] Testing Conventions

## Test Framework
[Detected: Jest/Vitest/Pytest/etc.]

## Test Structure

### Unit Tests
Location: `[discovered test path]`
Pattern:
\`\`\`typescript
// [Pattern from existing tests]
\`\`\`

### Integration Tests
Location: `[discovered test path]`
Pattern:
\`\`\`typescript
// [Pattern from existing tests]
\`\`\`

## Running Tests

\`\`\`bash
# All tests
[discovered command]

# Single file
[discovered command]

# Watch mode
[discovered command]
\`\`\`

## Mocking Conventions

[Based on analysis of test files]
```

### Step 5: Generate Deployment Skill

```markdown
---
name: [project]-deployment
description: Deployment workflow for [project]
---

# [Project] Deployment

## Environments

| Environment | URL | Branch |
|-------------|-----|--------|
| [Discovered environments from CI/CD] |

## Deployment Process

### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Lint clean
- [ ] Build successful
- [ ] [Project-specific checks]

### Deploy Commands

\`\`\`bash
# [Commands discovered from CI/CD or package.json]
\`\`\`

## Rollback Process

[Based on CI/CD analysis or documented process]
```

### Step 6: Generate Setup Skill

```markdown
---
name: [project]-setup
description: Development environment setup for [project]
---

# [Project] Dev Setup

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js/Python/Rust version]
- [Database requirements]
- [Other dependencies]

## Quick Start

\`\`\`bash
# Clone
git clone [repo]

# Install dependencies
[detected install command]

# Setup environment
[detected setup steps]

# Start development
[detected dev command]
\`\`\`

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| [From .env.example analysis] |

## Common Issues

[Based on README or docs analysis]
```

## Post-Generation

After generating:

```
Skills generated at .claude/skills/

Skills created:
- [project]-patterns.md - Coding patterns (47 patterns found)
- [project]-testing.md - Test conventions
- [project]-deployment.md - Deployment workflow
- [project]-setup.md - Dev environment setup

These skills are now available for this project.

Would you like me to review and refine any of them?
```

## Customization

Generated skills can be:
1. Edited to add more patterns
2. Extended with team-specific conventions
3. Linked from CLAUDE.md for automatic loading

## Integration

**Requires:**
- Project analysis (via analyze-project skill)

**Enables:**
- Project-specific guidance
- Consistent coding patterns
- Faster onboarding
- Team convention enforcement
